[CV](https://github.com/sumit-mehta1992/sumit-mehta1992.github.io/blob/main/Sumit_Mehta_CV.pdf)

I am currently working on Continuum Mechanics, Applied Mathematics, Soft biological tissues, Non-linear elasticity, Bifurcation Analysis.
In particular, working on large deformation in soft solids under external parameters and constraints which leads to mechanical instabilities.
