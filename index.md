I am currently working on Continuum Mechanics, Applied Mathematics, Soft biological tissues, Non-linear elasticity, Bifurcation Analysis.

In particular, working on large deformation in soft solids under external parameters and constraints which leads to mechanical instabilities.

Academics can use this home page to describe their research interests, display their latest publications, or provide an introduction to their research group.
